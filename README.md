# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: **Taina Noel**  
Time spent: **5 hours**

App Summary
For this assignment, I recreated a layout inspired by Duolingo but adapted it for an Animals-Only App. My version is themed around cats, and the layout shows a simple pet profile.
Features Implemented
✔ ConstraintLayout used as the root layout
✔ Profile image centered at the top
✔ Username text ("catlover123") centered below the image
✔ Bio line (“Just a cat living her best life 🐱”) with an emoji
✔ Proper spacing, margins, and alignment following layout best practices
✔ Animal theme clearly represented
✔ All views properly constrained to parent or each other
✔ Clean UI similar to the Duolingo style screenshot provided
